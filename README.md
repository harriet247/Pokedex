# Pokemon Website

This is a CPSC 455 project.
Project Progress after Workshop 1

First step:
Brainstorm some ideas for the first lab. In Lab 1, we will finalize groups, and discuss project ideas. By Lab 2, you should have selected a project topic. 


Project Requirements:
Must be completed with your group before workshop 2


*  Let TAs know who your group members are (we will do some icebreaker exercises today)
*  Must have a repo in github which all group members can access and send us the link on slack. (See instructions “How to hand in” below.)
   * In order to create a repo, you will need to decide on a project name
  project name: Pokemon Website
*  Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
   * Who is it for?
       *Pokemon lovers
   * What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
     1.Search for different pokemons
     2. User can collect pokemons
     3. User can Filter pokemons by their types
   * What type of data will it store?
     Pokemon:Image, number, char
     User/Admin Account: number, char
   * What will users be able to do with this data?
      1. Users: Search for pokemons
      2. Users: Filter pokemons based on their types
      3. Users: Add the pokemons they collect to their user account
   * What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
     1. Admin can add or delete pokemons
     2. Users can add comments to pokemons 
     3. Website can recognize pokemon pictures by ML.

*  Project task requirements:
   * 3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
      1. Users can Search for different pokemons
      2. Users can collect pokemons
      3. Users can Filter pokemon according to their types
      4. Users can sign up or login to their accounts    
   
   * 3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)

      1. Admin can login an Admin account
      2. Add pokemons to database by Admin
      3. Delete pokemons from database by Admin

   * 2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete at least 1)
      1. The website can recognize pokemon pictures by ML.
      2. Users can make comments for different pokemons
      3. Support different languages for users (e.g English and Chinese)

*  Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
   *  This will help you divide up work among your teammates
      A. Users can search pokemon
       1. Create Database for Pokemon
       2. Search function based on the Pokemon name
       3. Search page which displays pokemon info and user can collect pokemon from here

      B. Users can Collect Pokemons 
Create Database for User, every user has a list of collected pokemons. Have different function Apis to manipulate this list (Add/Remove/Update)
      2.   Login page for user to do authentication
      3.   After a user clicks on the collect button on Search page, that pokemon will be added   to that user’s collection list
      4.   Collection page shows collected pokemons by a user.
*  Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.
 




How to hand in:
Put all of the writing (Project Description, Project Task requirements, task breakdown), as well as your prototypes into the README of your project repo. Send the repo link to your lab TAs in a slack channel along with your group members. ALSO, for each team member, go on slack and edit your profile. In the “What I do” space, put your team name!
